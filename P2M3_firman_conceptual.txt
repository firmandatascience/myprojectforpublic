- Objective : This note is to answer the conceptual questions in the Milestone project 3.




1. NoSQL, or not only SQL, is a database management that can handle various data. This category can help process data
     with high variance, which cannot be handled by the traditional database (SQL). This category is also very
    typical for those who want to get flexibility and efficiency in data processing.

2. It is recommended to use NoSQL when the data is unstructured or semi-structured when there is complex modeling,
    and when there is rapid data change. Based on the character of the NoSQL, these conditions are suitable for
    this management category.

3. MongoDB: This platform's advantages include a wide ecosystem, schema flexibility, and high-intensity query.
   Couchbase 's advantages of this platform are high performance in data saving, multi-mode deployment, and easy query.

4. Airflow is a platform that can help users automate the tasks that were defined before. It will help those who need to
    scheduling and executing a list of functions automatically.

5. Great Expectation is a tool that can help users in data validating that will be used in the application require
    a certain level of standard.

6. Batch processing is a tool used to process collected data in a certain period, such as monthly. The data will
    be stored from day 1 to day 31, and those data will be processed at midnight. An easy example
    is that the last month's presence logs will be processed at the beginning of the month in the Human Resources Department.
    The presence data will not collected daily because it will be used for salary payments that are calculated monthly.
    In short,batch processing is suitable for non-real-time data, scheduled processes, and significant data volume.
    We can use many batch processing tools, but Airflow is one of them.
